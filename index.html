                            <div class="space"></div>
                            <p> I am a fourth-year McGill student who is passionate about game development. I am from China, a country where video game industry has not been fully developped. 
                                Just like many other kids, when I was young all I wanted was to make my own game one day. 
                            </p>   
                            <p> After years, I have come to realize that a game is more than just a program that you play to kill your time.
                                Beyong the fun that game brings, it is a communication of ideas between designers and players. A great game is a masterpiece that perfectly blends interaction, stories, art, music altogether, bringing players an immersive experience that is 
                                hard to be told by movies and books. In my life, it brings me laughter, it brings me tears, it even brings me anger, sympathy, and friendship with my teammates. Essentially, these thoughts drive me to keep playing games, appreciating games and now, making games. 
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                                Over the last 2 years, besides my school work, I have been learning how to design and make games, working on several projects, and eventually, slowly marching towards my goal.<br>
                            </p>   
                            <p> I am most familiar with the development in Unity, from assets management, scene management down to code implementation. I am equipped with knowledge about game objects and components, MVC pattern and generic programming that helps me program simple and usable code. 
                                Moreover, discovering the power of linear algebra helps me greatly, as well as learning 3D modeling in Autodest Maya. Recently, I step my foot into shader and grpahics fields, and studied
                                shader programming in both Unity and OpenGL.

We programed a central system that allows AI agent to communicate with each other to carry out simple strategic task, as well as reporting player's location.

                                <p>
                                In this project, the task is to design an AI that can play a chess game called <strong>Pentago Swap</strong>, which is derived from a much more popular game Pentago. 
                                This was held as a competition in class with total 289 participants, trying to beat each other's AI model and reach the top. 
                                The final performance for my design helps me land at <strong>10th place</strong> in the whole competition  
                                </p>
                                <p>The description of rules is <a href="Files/project_specification.pdf">here</a></p>
                                <p>The project provides me a great opportunity to expreiment AI algorithms with my own choice. Based on the rules, there are many possible ways to achieve this task, such as Monte Carlo techinique or MiniMax algorithms.
                                Specifically, I choose the <strong>MiniMax algorithms with Alpha-Beta prunning</strong> to speed up the processing time.
                                <p>Highlight of points lead to good performance:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>Board representation</p>
                                        <p>Design my own representation of board that summarizes only the important information I need to process, such as if there are pieces three in a row, or potential swapping chance for me to win. It is also easier for me to exmaine future board status with less computation.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>Minimax algorithms at each move with iterative deepening.</p> 
                                        <p>Iterative deepening will ensure that time is fully used at each move. Moreover, at each layer, all the tree leaves are stored using a min heap so it will be dynamically sorted whenever a new state is added.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>Evaluation at each single board state captures the information well. </p>
                                        <p>It fully analyses board from four different orientation, and considering a same board state from both sides' angle to calculate the score that represents our advantages or disadvantages.</p>

                                    I coded my ray tracer as the final project in graphics course, and participated a in class rendering competition. My path tracing rendering was mentioned as 2nd place in the whole class.

                                <p>
                                    We were asked to code a basic ray tracer that supports object intersection and direct illumination. Further than that, I coded my own BSDF and integrator that enables Monte Carlo sampling on surface light, and eventually, explicit path tracing wit different importance sampling.
                                    For BSDF, beyong the basic diffuse and specular material, I implemented mirror bsdf and fresnel bsdf that models the look of mirror and glasses.

                            In some modern stealth video games, sound propagation is neglected or poorly implemented causing unsatisfactory gaming experience. My research aims to develop a model to simulate the physicalpropagation of sound, in the perspective of reflection and diffraction,analysing various factors, and eventually grant game agents theability of sound identification and navigation.
